**#Iris Flowers Classification ML Project**
This project serves as a fundamental introduction to Machine Learning, often dubbed as the "Hello World" of ML. The Iris Flowers dataset, a classic in the field, provides an ideal starting point for beginners to delve into supervised ML algorithms. It comprises numeric attributes, making it straightforward to handle, and its small size allows easy loading into memory without necessitating complex transformations or scaling.

Dataset Description:
The Iris Flowers dataset contains samples of three species of iris flowers, with four features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each instance into one of the three species based on these features.
